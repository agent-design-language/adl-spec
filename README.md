# Agent Design Language (ADL)

Agent Design Language (ADL) is a declarative language for specifying
AI agents, tools, workflows, and execution contracts.

ADL separates **design-time intent** from **runtime execution**.
It enables deterministic prompt assembly, explicit output contracts,
and traceable agent runs across different model providers.

This repository contains the **language specification** for ADL 1.x.

## Status
- Current version: ADL 1.0 (draft)

- Deterministic prompting
- Fail loudly, repair explicitly
- Traceable, debuggable runs
