# ADL Specification

This directory contains the normative specification for Agent Design Language (ADL).

- **ADL 1.0:** `spec/1.0/`

ADL is a design-time language. Runtime artifacts (sessions, traces, retries) are out of scope for the language definition, but are described where they affect observable behavior.
